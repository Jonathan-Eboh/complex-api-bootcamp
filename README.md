Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, dictionary Api and image bank Api!

An application that allows the user to type in a word in English, select the part of speech then receive a translation of that word in addition to an image directly related to that word!

Optimizations:

This was the first application where I was using two apis, both specializing in differing data. The dictionary APIs end point includes a store
of text based information. The return from that object has words that I then used to ping the endpoint of an API that stores large amounts of images.

working with two different languages as well a media types was a very fun and challenging learning experience
